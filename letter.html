              I am a Software Engineer who spends most of his time at home, taking up programming as a hobby <br>
              I listen to Metal Music and play computer games like DarkSouls. I love to Dance and do sports. <br>
              Ocassionally I get to go to pubs and enjoy beer with friends, but lately with the Corona Virus spread<br>
              it is restricted to go outside the house and have an outing. So instead what I do is program and take online courses <br>
              but for the most part I would like to talk about my perspective of the world and the way I see it in short and <br>
              thank you for seeing this website. as it is dislikable to waste our lives on fighting and making wars, here comes the Corona <br>
              to teach us a lesson how to unite and take a one sided purpose of humanity and living with each other <br>
              it is quite Ironic how chilish human being turn to be once they realize the need of inter living and self respect. <br>
              and why would we make it any different if we know that humans all equal and that real enemies are for all together. <br>
              so lets be more serious and take aside the negative thoughts that demolish good relations and be solid about it. <br>
              let's do more good than selfish in these times and let's not forget that it's all about love and music!. <br>
              so what do you think? what is the purpose of human life in your perspective? see my email attached in the first page <br>
              and send me your reply. thanks.</p>
