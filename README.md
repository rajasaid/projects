Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


#some remarks:

1. I have not yet registered fully to the course with an option to get a certificate. 
I am willing to do so only later if I end up happy with the progression of the course. 


2. I don;t have a camera to record myself explaining. 

3. it is a hompage with 4 pages, main page is straight forward. 
then we have pictures (pictures.html) page and then a letter (letter.html) page 
and then resume (resume.html), all of which are straught forward.

4. I made minimal sass programming, just as requested, since the result wasn't affected.
as it seems we didn;t have much to learn about sass programming to make a real difference so far.


thanks.
